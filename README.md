Project Title: AI-Enhanced QR Code System for Restaurant Orders
(ScanAndEat)

Abstract

In modern hotels and restaurants, the dining experience can be significantly enhanced through the integration of advanced technology. This project introduces an AI-enhanced QR code system designed to streamline the ordering process, improve efficiency, and elevate customer satisfaction.
Traditional black-and-white QR codes are replaced with colorful, visually appealing, AI-generated QR codes placed on each table. When a customer scans the QR code, they are directed to an animated, interactive, and functional menu website. Here, users can browse the menu, select their desired items, and place their order.
The order, along with the table number, is then transmitted to the chef's device, where all requested orders are displayed, detailing the items to be prepared. This system allows chefs to manage orders efficiently and keep track of preparation requirements.
Simultaneously, the customer's website interface provides real-time updates on the estimated time for their food to be prepared and delivered to their table. Customers have the option to pay manually to the waiter or through a UPI-based digital payment system.
An additional component of this project is the admin panel, exclusively accessible to the hotel owner. This panel allows the owner to monitor daily transactions and gain insights into sales data, providing a comprehensive overview of the restaurant’s performance.
Overall, this project comprises three main parts:
The user-friendly website for customers to select menu items and place orders.
The chef's interface to manage and track incoming orders.
The owner’s admin panel to review transaction details and operational analytics.
This AI-enhanced QR code system not only modernizes the dining experience but also enhances operational efficiency and provides valuable data insights for the restaurant management.
